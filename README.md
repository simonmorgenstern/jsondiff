# jsondiff
## Compare two JSON Objects for differences
This code was inspired by https://gomakethings.com/getting-the-differences-between-two-objects-with-vanilla-js/

The script will compare the Objects for: 
1. added keys
2. changed values
3. removed keys

The results will be written into new differences.json file.
